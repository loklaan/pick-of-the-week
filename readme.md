## Again, why?

At [Rex Software](https://github.com/rexsoftware), we do a thing called [Dev Bevs](http://www.rexsoftware.com/dev-bevs/).  
In this project, I keep track of my own picks through out the week, so that I can quickly present them during these informal meetings. :sparkles:

As the project ages, my picks will show my trending interests, and perhaps serves to share oldie-but-goodies, from days yonder, to future developers!
